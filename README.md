### This is a data analysis project I conducted using a dataset obtained by web scraping information on university majors and their salaries from the website: https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors.

### The analysis employs the pandas library and leverages various methods available for data analysis and processing. The project aims to predict university majors that offer high starting salaries, mid-career salaries, high-potential majors, and majors with higher risks, among other factors for the year 2023. 

### The project begins with the analysis on the 2008 datset of university majors and the salaries. Later the webscrapping technique using the BeautiSoup library is used to collect the 2023 dataset. Further analysis is done leveraging the pandas library.
